All right, I've done a little bit more on the front-end here. I'm trying to find a dark, reader-friendly color scheme but the time being I'm sitting on this simple black and grey. I'm thinking about throwing in some blue for the background (I'm obsessed with the blue hue) and just deciding on what KIND of blue is troubling enough. Picking a font color is probably going to problematic as well. I've thrown in the file link for my resume into the CV link at the top, so this site isn't so stuck on the single homepage. Hmm, I just got an idea for the Archive, to help it save space for listing posts by adding in the content preview as a hover option. Might be cool, although I'm actually not sure if that's something I can do with the tools I've got included so far.
This short experience has been pretty humbling, reminding me through unavoidable trials that I don't know that much HTML and I've still got some way to go before I can start flying through the page formatting. I've got some time until Monday to put into it, so hopefully I can get somewhere.
I'm thinking about using a custom font for some parts of the page, maybe throwing around some cursive for the title and other signature items like that.

Well, I'm done writing this, I was just doing it to test how my Jekyll setup for content excerpts comes out for the homepage.
