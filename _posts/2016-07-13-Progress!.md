All right, so it's been a while but I've gotten around to making a little script to make the post-creating process a bit easier. I wanted to get around to implementing a posting feature on-site, but apparently I'll need to be running an Ajax server to handle the function calls to write to the posts folder.

I've also settled on a font scheme that I like; always had a soft spot for handwriting styles, especially those that are comparable to my own. I'm still not sure how freely I want to express thoughts on this site yet, since such exposure in today's world can be really dangerous (at least if I'm looking to get a job with some organization).
I've got it in my head that maybe I could try my hand at some programming tutorials testify to some kind of ability I have to teach, to refer to for employers. Although, I suppose I would need some sort of feedback/recognition for that to mean anything, so I would need to grow the attention this site would get (and I'm REALLY not motivated to do that).

Well, in any case, I've got nothing else to say. Off to the internet with you, Post.
